1st Question - Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.


 Solution:


The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities is one of association and categorization.

One-to-Many Relationship:

Each product belongs to exactly one product category, but a product category can have multiple products associated with it. This means that each record in the "Product" table (entity) is linked to exactly one record in the "Product_Category" table through the category_id foreign key column in the "Product" table, which references the primary key (id) in the "Product_Category" table.

Many-to-One Perspective:

From the perspective of "Product_Category", there can be many products belonging to the same category. This allows for grouping similar products together under a common category, which can aid in organization and navigation within a system. This relationship enables efficient organization and retrieval of products based on their respective categories. 


2nd Question - How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?


Solution:

To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can enforce referential integrity using foreign key constraints in your database schema.

Foreign Key Constraint: In the "Product" table, the category_id column serves as a foreign key referencing the primary key (id) column of the "Product_Category" table.

When defining the foreign key constraint, specify that the category_id column in the "Product" table references the id column in the "Product_Category" table.

This foreign key constraint ensures that each value in the category_id column of the "Product" table must exist as a primary key value in the id column of the "Product_Category" table. Thus, any attempt to insert or update a product with a category_id that does not exist in the "Product_Category" table will be rejected by the database, thereby ensuring that each product is assigned a valid category.
